# OOP
This project is about object oriented in Java

This project is divided into three entities.
For each entity, the addition and deletion operation must be implemented in the most efficient manner W.C.

Class A indicates the fastest addition to the collection, followed by quick delete as quickly as possible,
Which means the priority is to add quickly and then to delete quickly.
I implement it with the construction of Linked List that i create.

Class B The delete and add operation should be done in the same W.C.
I implement it with a queue with priorities like max heap.

The C class describes a very fast delete operation and priority add operation after the fastest deletion.
I implement it with the construction of Linked List that i create.

LinkedListA 
Add-set all entity that add in the first location.
Delete - Go through the entire list and delete the entity with the maximum value.

LinkedListC
Add- Put each entity in its exact location by value.
Delete- delete the first entity.
